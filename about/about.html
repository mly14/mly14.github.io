      <p>Hey, I'm Megan! I am a senior at the University of Washington, studying Human-Centered Design & Engineering with a Data Science concentration and minor in Climate Science. I value empathy and being able to help others through design. My focus is predominantly UX design, but I'm interested in exploring data science to inform design decisions. â€‹In my free time, I enjoy baking, traveling, trying new restaurants, listening to musicals, and exploring parks.</p>
