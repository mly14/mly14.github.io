      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        My final project is a game using the p5 js library. My game can be
        played <a href="https://mly14.github.io/levels-final/">here</a>.
      </p>
      <img alt="Gif of Levels game in action" src="images/final_gif.gif" />
      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          My MVP already had the main functionality of the game and the
          leaderboard database connection. The next thing I added was formatting
          the data in a more appealing way. In my final version, the data is
          displayed only on the game over page. I also revised the styling to
          vary the font size and font type by importing Google fonts.
        </li>
        <img
          alt="Game over screen with username input field and top scores leaderboard"
          src="images/game_over.png"
          class="screenshot"
        />

        <li>
          I changed the button styles by rounding the corners and positioned it
          to be in the middle of the canvas.
        </li>
        <img
          alt="Game start screen"
          src="images/start_screen.png"
          class="screenshot"
        />

        <li>
          I randomized the width of the platforms to make the game more
          interesting.
        </li>
        <img
          alt="Levels game with varying sizes of platforms"
          src="images/game_on.png"
          class="screenshot"
        />
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>

      <p>
        I had a lot of difficulty positioning the button and text input
        elements. I wanted them to be inside the canvas but it seemed like they
        were separate elements. I tried using the .parent() function to attach
        them to a div. This didn't work because the button would be positioned
        next to the canvas when I wanted it to be in the center. I spent a lot
        of time Googling. Eventually, I realized the elements were created in
        the DOM so that was messing with positioning. I looked into how to
        position two elements on top of each other. I found
        <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6780614/css-how-to-position-two-elements-on-top-of-each-other-without-specifying-a-hei"
          >this</a
        >
        Stackoverflow post that suggested changing the use relative and absolute
        positioning. After fiddling around in the Developer Tools panel with the
        styles, I finally got it to work.

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This was the same goal from my MVP. The counter right now is just
          measuring the number of platforms that have appeared, I want to change
          it to measure the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          I achieved my goal of varying the widths of the platforms but didn't
          implement the increasing speed function.
        </li>
        <li>I'd like to add some music and sound effects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kudos</h2>

        <li>
          Kudos to Hannah for helping me getting the database data to render
          correctly.
