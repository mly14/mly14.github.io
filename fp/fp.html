      <h2>General Description</h2>
      <p>
        For my final project, I am making a game that will use Firebase to
        implement a user login flow and backend database that stores high
        scores.
      </p>

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <img src="images/fp0_startscreen.jpg" class="screenshot" />
      <img src="images/fp0_game.jpg" class="screenshot" />
      <img src="images/fp0_endscreen.jpg" class="screenshot" />
      <h2>Descriptions</h2>
      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        For my prototype, I will have the login, fundamentals of the game, and
        backend storing high scores working. The main parts of my game will be
        the rising platforms and the rolling ball. The ball will be controlled
        with the arrow keys.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h3>Final Version</h3>
      <p>
        My final version will have more interesting styling such as adding a
        face to the ball. I will add a fun background. I will also make the game
        more challenging by gradually increasing the speed of the platform. To
        make it more fun, I will add power-ups. If you collect a power-up you
        can go through the platforms for a certain amount of time.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>

      <h3>Prototype Version</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make the game with the rising platforms and rolling ball.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Add a starting screen.</li>
        <li>Add a game over screen with a replay button.</li>
        <li>Set up the firebase database.</li>
        <li>
          Add a login screen to the game and have information stored in the
          database
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a high scores to the game over screen that displays the top 5
          players.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Final Version</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Add stylings to the game to make it more visually appealing. This will
          include changing font styles and adding color. I may also add
          animation to the ball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add some difficulty to the game by gradually increasing the speed of
          the platforms.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>A list of known unknowns</h2>
      <p>
        I don&rsquo;t know much about Firebase but from Hannah&rsquo;s tutorial
        and the resources she&rsquo;s provided, I will learn how to use it to
        implement a database storing users and high scores. I will need to
        figure out to get my game to display data from the database. I
        didn&rsquo;t use p5 Play for the previous assignment so I&rsquo;ll need
        to read through the documentation and familiarize myself with the
        methods.
      </p>

      <h2>Stretch goals.</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my stretch goals are about making the game more visually
        appealing and interesting.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          If I have time I will change the face on the ball. Once it gets closer
          to the top, it will turn into a sad face.
        </li>
        <li>
          I want to add &ldquo;power-ups&rdquo; so when the ball collects it,
          the platforms will move out of the way&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          I will also have buttons for starting and replaying the game instead
          of just clicking anywhere on the screen.
        </li>
        <li>I will add music and sound effects.&nbsp;</li>
      </ul>
