      <h2>Overview and Usage</h2>
      <p>
        My final project is a game using the p5 js library. My game can be
        played here.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I began with just the ball and a single rising platform. This was an
          idea I found from the examples on the p5 play website.
        </li>
        <img src="images/1.jpg" />

        <li>I added rising squares that would be turned into platforms.</li>
        <img src="images/2.jpg" />

        <li>
          I changed the shape of the squares into skinny rectangles to look more
          like a platform.
        </li>
        <img src="images/3.jpg" />

        <li>
          I added a counter to keep track of the score and a face for the ball.
          I also added a stretch effect so the ball will be animated when
          moving.
        </li>
        <img src="images/4.jpg" />

        <li>I added a start and end screen with buttons.&nbsp;</li>
        <img src="images/startscreen.png" />
        <li>
          I created a Firebase database to store high scores. I hooked it up to
          my game to show the contents of the database to the player
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        <strong>Issue Deep-Dive:</strong>&nbsp;Description of an issue you ran
        into, and the steps you took to resolve it
      </p>

      <p>
        I make a file called sketch.js which contained code for my game. I also
        had another js file called index.js with some functions that connect to
        my Firebase backend. I didn&#39;t know how to send information like the
        score which is in my sketch.js file to my index.js file which contained
        the functions I needed to send data into my database. I went to
        Hannah&#39;s office hours and she helped me resolve this problem by
        attaching certain functions in my index.js file to the window. This made
        them accessible from my sketch.js so I was able to connect my game data
        to my database.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Ideas and Future Work:</strong>&nbsp;Ideas for what features you
        might like to add to your project in the future (can be bullet points)
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I need to debug my code, sometimes the game will just freeze and
          I&#39;m not sure what the problem is.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          The counter right now is just measuring the number of platforms that
          have appeared, I want to change it to measure the time.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
          The game is pretty straightforward. I want to make it harder by
          increasing the speed and vary the size of the platforms.&nbsp;
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Kudos:</strong>&nbsp;Links to any particularly useful resources
        you found during your project. You should also credit any classmates or
        friends who helped you.

      <ul>
        <li>Kudos to Hannah for helping me with my issue above.</li>
        <li>The p5 documentation was super useful too.&nbsp;</li>
