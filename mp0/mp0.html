      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The first thing I did was change the background color and font. I found a font I liked from Google Fonts and implemented it quickly by including an import link at the top of the CSS file.</li>
        <img src="images/screenshot 1.jpg" class="screenshot">
        <li>I created the other pages by copying the current HTML file into separate folders - one for each page.</li>
        <li>I wanted to make a navigation bar to have a way to access my other pages. I found a nav bar I liked from CodePen. I took the code and modified it to suit my needs. I added the code for the nav bar to all my pages.</li>
        <img src="images/screenshot 2.jpg" class="screenshot">
        <li>I adjusted the styling a bit more. For example, I made the navbar wider than my body content.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>When I tried to make the rotate animation, I was having trouble making it only rotate once. The example code I was looking at specified "infinite" animation which meant it would keep rotating. I tried changing the animation-iteration-count value to "1" but it was still not the effect I was going for. The text would rotate 360 degrees and then rotate back. I just wanted it to rotate 360 degrees and end there. The solution was to specify 0.5 times. I learned that the animation-iteration-count property could take decimals.</p>

      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <p>I added a rotate animation to the "Megan" text in my nav bar. I chose this transition because it looks cool and provides more interaction and movement for the user to enjoy. I used the @keyframes rule to specify an animation in CSS. I applied the rotate function to achieve the desired effect. </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future</h2>
      <p>I'd like to add an animation to the homepage. Something big and graphic that can really catch someone's attention. I will see if I can make it interactive so the user can have fun playing around on my site. Right now, my portfolio is still a bit plain. I would like to add a footer, adjust the font styles, and add some more color to the text or more images.</p>
